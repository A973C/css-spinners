Spinner.css
===========

Simple CSS spinners and throbbers made with CSS.

## Markup

All spinners are designed to be used with the following markup:

    <div class="spinner-class-name">
      Loading...
    </div>

Simply replace "spinner-class-name" with the spinner of your choice.

## Using CSS

To use a specific spinner link the appropriate file:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/spinner/throbber.css">

Or, if you'd like to have access to the entire library of spinners you can link the root file:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/spinners.css">

Then apply the appropriate class name for the spinner of your choice to the markup:

    <div class="throbber">
      Loading...
    </div>
